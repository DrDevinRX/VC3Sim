*Items are autolooted after the fight, but only the last 10
    - Counting items that players grab manually is VERY hard to account for

*Items are duplicated upon autoloot



TODO:
1. Simulate the drop logic.
    - Simulate percentages.
    - Put results into a list.
    - Slice off everything before the last 10 items.
    - Duplicate drops from each run.
    - Determine based on list if we got VC3 materials.

2. Better Pit kill data.
3. Possibly visualize the results
    - Pie Chart
    - Excel results
4. VC3 + Taunt % calculation
